DIVIDE AND CONQUER NOTES 

H/W : time O(nlogn) and space complexity of merge sort and also find out if we can do merge sort without    
      extra space which is called in place merge sort.
H/W : Problem : INVERSION COUNT on YT or Google

QUICK SORT : It has two logics first one is PARTITION LOGIC : where we select a pivot element it can be any 
             element from the array but generally we take the first element as pivot and then we place that  
             element in its correct position and elements bigger than pivot goes on right side and smaller 
             elements goes on left side of the pivot element.
             RECURSIVE LOGIC : it sorts the left and right halfs of an array.
And rest we leave it upto recursion coz ek case hum samhal le baki recursion samhal lega. 
TIME COMPLEXITY : best and avg case = O(nlogn), worst case (when arr is reverse sorted) = O(n*n)
